# Three.js Journey

## Setup

Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```

# Debug UI

We need to change things easily so we make a debug UI on the screen

We can make one or we can use a library

1. dat.GUI
2. control-panel
3. ControlKit
4. Guify
5. Qui
